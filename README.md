# prodigy: PRObability DIstributions via GeneratingfunctionologY

prodigy is a prototypical tool for the analysis of probabilistic integer programs with `while`-loops. It is based on (probability) generating functions.

Given an almost-surely terminating loop `while(G) {B}` and a loop-free (specification) program `I` (also called _invariant_), prodigy checks whether `while(G) {B}` and `I` are _equivalent_ programs, i.e., they yield the same output distribution on every possible input distribution.

## Booting the VM

Download the VM image and open it in your virtualization software. We have tested everything with VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org), using 8GB of RAM.
The login credentials for the VM are user `CAV` and password `ae`.

## Smoke test

For a quick test to see if everything works you may execute the following steps:
* Open a terminal by right-clicking on the desktop.
* `cd prodigy/frontend/`
* Run `poetry shell`
* Run `python probably/cli.py`

You should see the output `Usage: cli.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...` in the terminal.

## Reproducing the examples from the paper

Our example programs are located in the `~/Desktop/prodigy/frontend/pgfexamples` folder.
We now describe how you can run our tool on these examples.
* Open a terminal by right-clicking on the desktop.
* `cd prodigy/frontend/`
* Run `poetry shell`
* Execute `./run_equiv_examples.sh --engine prodigy` to run the single-loop examples from Section 6 and Appendix E of the paper. This should not take more than 1 minute.

> _Hint:_ You can exchange the computer algebra backend with the `--engine` option. Possible alternatives are `prodigy` and `sympy`. The former enables our C++ backend based on the GiNaC package. The latter employs the python computer algebra package sympy. `prodigy` is generally faster than `sympy`.

The examples involving more than one loop, i.e. nested (Example 5) or sequential (Example 11), require some more manual effort:
* Run `python probably/cli.py --engine prodigy main pgfexamples/nested_while.pgcl` for the nested loop example.
* When prompted, choose option _[1] Solve using invariants_ by typing `1` in the terminal
* Specify the outer loop's invariant by typing `pgfexamples/nested_while_inv_outer.pgcl`
* Choose option _[1] Solve using invariants_ again to specify the second invariant.
* Specify the inner loop's invariant by typing `pgfexamples/nested_while_inv_inner.pgcl`

Observe that in the case of nested loops, the two invariants are verified jointly once both have been specified.

Next consider the sequential loops example:
* Run `python probably/cli.py --engine prodigy main pgfexamples/sequential_loops.pgcl` for the sequential loops example.
* When prompted, choose option _[1] Solve using invariants_ by typing `1` in the terminal
* Specify the first loop's invariant by typing `pgfexamples/sequential_loops_first_inv.pgcl`
* Choose option _[1] Solve using invariants_ again to specify the second invariant.
* Specify the second loop's invariant by typing `pgfexamples/sequential_loops_second_inv.pgcl`



## Running your own example

To experiment with our tool on a custom example, you need to create two files: A program consisting of a single `while`-loop and a loop-free invariant/specification program (the supported syntax is specified further below).
* In folder `prodigy/frontend/` open an editor by typing e.g. `nano myexample.pgcl`
* Write a program with a single `while`-loop such as this:
    ```
    nat n; nat x;
    while(n > 0) {
        n := n - 1;
        { x := 0; } [1/2] { x := 1; }
    }
    ```
* The effect of the above program can be summarized as follows: If `n > 0` initially, then `n` is set to zero and `x` is randomly assigned either `0` or `1`. This can be formally verified by writing the following loop-free invariant program (open a new editor by typing `nano myexample_inv.pgcl`):
    ```
    nat n; nat x;
    if(n > 0) {
        { x := 0; } [1/2] { x := 1; }
        n := 0;
    } else {}
    ```
* Check using that your invariant is correct using
    ```
    python probably/cli.py --engine prodigy main myexample.pgcl 
    ```
    and when promted type `1` followed by your invariant file `myexample_inv.pgcl`.
* Optionally, you can append an input distribution in PGF notation to the above line, e.g. `n^5` (meaning that `n=5` initially with probability 1). The tool will then output the resulting distribution after the loop. In the above example, you should see `1/2 + 1/2*x` which means that `x=0` and `x=1` hold with probability `1/2` each.
